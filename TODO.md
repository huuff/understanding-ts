# Tasks
Almost got it to work with webpack (and webpack dev server) but it crashes with CSP errors. Currently to run it: 
  * Copy `app.css` and `index.html` to `dist`
  * Change the path of `dist/bundle.js` to `budle.js` in `index.html`
I need to compile the html with webpack and put it into dist for everything to work. Also webpack is not livereloading.
